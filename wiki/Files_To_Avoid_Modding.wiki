#summary A list of files to avoid changing.

== Summary ==
I'll post files that should not be changed here. There are three reasons for not changing certain files:

  # The file is shared with the engine code and unless the engine code is changed simultaneously as well, any changes to the code inside will have no effect.  
  # The file is shared with the engine code and unless the engine code is changed simultaneously as well, changes to the file *CRASH THE GAME!!!*
  # Changing the file will necessitate changing a file that falls into one of the above categories.

== List of Files ==

  * ===  q_shared.h ===
Changing declarations in this file can/will really confuse the server-especially any of the typedefs, structs, or enums.  Expect to crash the game when modding this as much of it is basically an API for the engine.  
  * === q_shared.c ===
Since all of q_shared.c's declarations are contained in q_shared.h, modding this file can necessitate changing q_shared.h.  It's probably best to leave it alone.
