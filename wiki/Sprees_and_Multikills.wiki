#summary Documentation on how to enable and configure killing/death sprees, and multi-kills. Note: Working document, check back often!

= Overview =

Killing Sprees, Death Sprees, and Multikills are new features introduced in revision [http://code.google.com/p/oax/source/detail?r=49 Revision 49]. These features add a level of customization which significantly enhances the multiplayer experience of OpenArena.  See each page below for more information on how to enable, customize, and work with these new features.

=== General Behavior ===

Killing Spree and Death Spree announcements occur along an interval specified by the server.  When a player attains a number of kills or deaths which is a multiple of that interval, a sound is played and a message is broadcast to the other players in the game.  

Multi-kills are meant to replace the stock "Excellent" award sound.  A sound and message can be specified for the "number" of kills a player achieves. While the award sound is replaced, the actual award, is not.  This means that the "Excellent" sprites will still be shown above the player's head, be drawn on the acheiving players screen, and the award will still be added to the player's historical award count (as visible in the UI). Please see the configuration page for more information.  

One important behavior worth mentioning is that Killing Sprees, Death Sprees, and Multikills are infinitely awarded, even though the number of levels that can be defined is finite.  When a player goes over the maximum level defined by the server, the server will merely repeat the sound and message for the highest level defined. ( See each configuration page for limits on the number of levels that can be defined.)
